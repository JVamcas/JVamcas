- 👋 Hi, I’m Petrus Kambala (from Namibia) but call me @JVamcas - a concat of Java + Vamcas. No need to guess that I'm a Java fanatic
- 👀 I’m interested in everything Java, Kotlin, cloud computing, Firebase,  SQL, Hibernate, Tomcat...
- Having completed a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cape Town, I enjoy the comfort of interfacing hardware and software.
- I love micro-controllers, microprocessors, FPGA, etc
- 🌱 I’m currently learning , Java Spring Framework,machine learning with focus on NLP but open to broadening my horizon,; I'm onto the C# train too - it makes it easy to dev Win based apps...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Java, Kotlin, SQL, Firebase, Hibernate, Tomcat., and yeah on Embedded Systems - I'd like to C-it.

- I'm Looking for work opportunities - remote or local are welcome. If you have a project you are working on, I'd like to hear about it.
